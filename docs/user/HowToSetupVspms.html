<P>VSPMS, a "Very Simple Project Management System", allows the user
to maintain multiple 'projects' each with a unique collection of predefined
environment settings.  A project is associated with a directory on disk.
The system keeps a list of your 'projects' in an index
file so that they can be quickly located. </P>
<P>The primary benefit of this package is that it allows you to specify a well-defined
and protected environment for your projects. A very important second benefit
is that it allows you to easily share your setup information and project locations
with coworkers. For example each working directory can have it's own project
file which will define the environment for that working directory. </P>
<H3><A name="using"></A>Using VSPMS</H3>
<P>After <A href="#install">installing</A> VSPMS, use the guide below to manage
your projects. </P>

Brief guide to VSPMS commands:

     alias            description:
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     lspj    lists your project names and locations.

     addpj [project_name]
        add the current working directory as "project_name". project_name
        should be short and easy to remember.
        Example:
        %cd ~/some/directory
        %addpj myproject

     chpj [project_name]
        changes the current project to "project_name",
        and sources the $PROJECTRC file to establish
        the project environment.  If no name is given,
        reestablishes the current project environment.
        Example:
        %chpj ffjbuild

     pushpj [project_name|+n]
        pushes the named project on the directory
        stack.  With no arguments, exchanges the
        top two projects.  The +n form rotates the
        nth project to the top of the stack. (Same
        semantics as pushd.)  Note that if you have
        a project defined as a sub-directory of
        another project, pushpj gets confused.  To
        recover, use chpj to reenter the project.

     poppj  pops the top project of the directory
        stack

     pjenv  prints the current project environment.

     newpjenv filename
        change project index file to filename.

     pjresethome <b>(csh/tcsh only)</b>
        Make the current environment the "base" environment.
        This command saves your current environment variable
        definitions and your current alias definitions to disk.
        Each time you change to a new project, All variables
        and aliases not in your base environment are deleted.
        Environment variables whose definitions have changed
        are reset to the original value.  However, alias that have
        been changed retain their new definition. (This is due
        to the technical difficulties in restoring aliases to
        their original form when they involve complicated quoting.
        Because of this, you should consider any alias you define
        in your home environment as global and read-only.)

    pjcleantmp
        Removes inactive VSPMS temporary files from /tmp

     pjname
        Returns the current project name.  Useful for adding the
        project name to prompt.  Use with setprompt alias.

            alias setprompt 'set prompt="{`pjname` \!} "'

     ========================== SUBPROJECTS ==========================

     subpj [sub_project_dir]
        change to a new sub-project.  Sub-projects are names
        of directories under the "main" project name, i.e.,
        if the project is comprised of directories:

            /usr/myproject/src/{include,lib,bin}

        and the main project directory is /usr/myproject/src,
        then possible sub-projects are:

            {include,lib,bin}

        In this example:

            subpj .   #will take you to /usr/myproject/src/. (the root)
            subpj lib   #will take you to the /usr/myproject/src/lib

        ####
        The $PROJECTRC (.projectrc) file for the project only needs to
        be created in the root project directory.  Thus
        sub-projects are defined to be all sub-trees
        sharing the same .projectrc file (and hence a
        common REV label, if there is one.)

     popspj
        pop a sub-project off the directory stack.

     pushspj [+n] [proj_name]
        push a new sub-project on directory stack.

<H3><A name="install"></A>How To Install VSPMS</H3>
<P>Installing VSPMS consists of downloading the VSPMS package, and extracting
the package contents, and setting up your startup files. </P>
<OL>
  <LI>Download the package for your platform. There is a package for both UNIX,
Cygwin and Windows (with MKS Toolkit installed).
     <UL>
        <LI>For UNIX and Cygwin users, download: <A href="/tbd.">tbd.</A></LI>
        <LI>For Windows (with MKS Toolkit installed) users, download: <A href="/tbd.">tbd.</A>.
        </LI>
     </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Extract the VSPMS package in the location where it will be run, The default
     directory is your home directory, $HOME.</LI>
  <LI>Update your startup files to initialize VSPMS. Refer to the section below
     <A href="#env">Set Your Environment</A></LI>
</OL>
<H3><A name="env"></A>Set Your Environment<BR>

<P>Each shell has a different environment configuration to initialize VSPMS. Below
  are the instructions to configure your environment appropriately.</P>
<P>Supported Shells UNIX and Cygwin: <A href="#csh">csh</A>, <A href="#tcsh">tcsh</A>,

  Supported Shells Windows with MKS Toolkit installed: <A href="#windows">ksh</A>
<BR>
</P>
<P>Note: The following examples assume you have installed VSPMS in your home directory,
  $HOME. If you have placed VSPMS in another directory, you must change the $VSPMSHOME
  value to the new location.</P>

<H3><A name="projects"></A>Managing Projects</H3>
<PRE>Your project index file (defined by $MYPROJECTS) has 2 columns of the following format:

     project_name    project_directory

This file may also include other files. Environment variables in %include statements are expanded.

Example:

     #########       ##########
     #nickname       directory
     #########       ##########
     fooproject     $HOME/foo
     #
     %include ~/myprojects.$HOSTNAME
</verbatim></PRE>
<P>Beware of nested includes - you may get unexpected results due to an unexpected
  ordering of the project list, or you may get into a recursive loop if two project
  index files include each other. Note that the second column is exposed to the
  shell, so meta-characters meaningful to the shell ("~", "$", etc.) will be expanded
  normally. </P>
<P>Each project_directory can have a $PROJECTRC file, to establish the project
  environment. Here is an example of a simple $PROJECTRC file</P>
<PRE>
     # .projectrc file
     setenv REV v100
     set path = (/usr/newstuff $path)
     echo HELLO, YOU ARE IN A PROJECT
</verbatim></PRE>
<P>Note that if $REV is defined, it is displayed whenever you issue one of the project navigational commands.
</P>
<H3><A name="startup"></A>Updating your startup file</H3>
<P>Some shells and their versions have different startup files. Also, startup
  files may be different based on whether or not they are login shells. Refer
  to the man pages for the shell you are using to determine which file you need
  to update. </P>
