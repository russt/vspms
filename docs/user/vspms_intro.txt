What is VSPMS?

VSPMS is the "Very Simple Project Management System".  It allows
you to store project locations in an index file, and use shortcuts
to get to your location.  It is designed to help you remember
where you put things, and to provide facilities to set up a
well defined and documented environment for your project.

It is an excellent tool for capturing procedures and
setup information that needs to be shared among a team.

The basic command that you need to understand is the "chpj"
alias.  This command performs the functional equivalent of
the following:

    cd `wherepj <myproj>`; source $PROJECTRC

The wherepj command looks up <myproj> (which is the shortcut
you define for your project directory), and returns the directory
where your project is located.  We then cd there and source
the $PROJECTRC file (if it exists).

In practice, things are a bit more complicated, and there are
some bells and whistles, but if you understand the above,
then you understand VSPMS.

Concept of "base environment":

This version of VSPMS has the concept of a "base" or "home"
environment that is set whenever you execute the first
chpj, pushpj, or pjresethome commands.  See the section
under "pjresethome" below for more information.

Brief guide to VSPMS commands:

    alias           description:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    lspj    lists your project names and locations.

    addpj [project_name]
        add the current working directory as "project_name"

    chpj [project_name]
        changes the current project to "project_name",
        and sources the $PROJECTRC file to establish
        the project environment.  If no name is given,
        re-establishes the current project environment.

    pushpj [project_name|+n]
        pushes the named project on the directory
        stack.  With no arguments, exchanges the
        top two projects.  The +n form rotates the
        nth project to the top of the stack. (Same
        semantics as pushd.)  Note that if you have
        a project defined as a sub-directory of
        another project, pushpj gets confused.  To
        recover, use chpj to re-enter the project.

    poppj   pops the top project of the directory
        stack

    pjenv   prints the current project environment.

    newpjenv filename
        change project index file to filename.

    pjresethome
        Make the current environment the "base" environment.
        This command saves your current environment variable
        definitions and your current alias definitions to disk.
        Each time you change to a new project, All variables
        and aliases not in your base environment are deleted.
        Environment variables whose definitions have changed
        are reset to the original value.  However, alias that have
        been changed retain their new definition. (This is due
        to the technical difficulties in restoring aliases to
        their original form when they involve complicated quoting.
        Because of this, you should consider any alias you define
        in your home environment as global and read-only.)

    ========================== SUBPROJECTS ==========================

    subpj [sub_project_dir]
        change to a new sub-project.  Sub-projects are names
        of directories under the "main" project name, i.e.,
        if the project is comprised of directories:

            /usr/myproject/src/{include,lib,bin}

        and the main project directory is /usr/myproject/src,
        then possible sub-projects are:

            {include,lib,bin}

        In this example:

            subpj .     #will take you to /usr/myproject/src/. (the root)
            subpj lib   #will take you to the /usr/myproject/src/lib

        The $PROJECTRC (.projectrc) file for the project only needs to
        be created in the root project directory.  Thus
        sub-projects are defined to be all sub-trees
        sharing the same .projectrc file (and hence a
        common REV label, if there is one.)

    popspj
        pop a sub-project off the directory stack.

    pushspj [+n] [proj_name]
        push a new sub-project on directory stack.

To use these commands, you must define the following environment
variable:

    setenv MYPROJECTS my_project_index

(Note that the default value for $MYPROJECTS is "~/myprojects". Edit
startup file (usually .cshrc) if you want to change it to something else.)

Your project index file has 2 columns:

    project_name    project_directory

You may create $MYPROJECT files that include other files.  Environment
variables in %include statements are expanded.

Example:

    #########       ##########
    #nickname       directory
    #########       ##########
    fooproject      $HOME/foo
    #
    %include ~russt/projects.$HOSTNAME

Beware of nested includes - you may get unexpected
results due to an unexpected ordering of the project list,
or you may get into a recursive loop if two project
index files include each other.

Note that the second column is exposed to the shell, so
meta-characters meaningful to the shell ("~", "$", etc.)
will be expanded normally.

The project location (directory) can have a $PROJECTRC file, to
establish the project environment - here is an example of a simple
$PROJECTRC file:

    # .projectrc file
    setenv REV v100
    set path = (/usr/newstuff $path)
    echo HELLO, YOU ARE IN A PROJECT

Note that if $REV is defined it is displayed whenever you change
to the project.
